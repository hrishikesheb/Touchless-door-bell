# Touchless-door-bell

This device is an automatic hand wash dispenser which dispenses a specific amount of hand sanitizer liquid on to the hands when placed under an ultrasonic sensor. This project is a good initiative to prevent spread of the COVID-19 virus as hand sanitizing is a good habit but the main problem lies the way we do it (physically touch the pump) which is not good if the bottle was touched by an infected person. Hence, with this project there is no physical contact to the bottle.
